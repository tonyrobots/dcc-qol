Overall Goal:
Convert this dcc-qol Foundry VTT module from one that works based on overrides of the core DCC-RPG system functions, and instead is event based, listening for hooks from the system and reacting accordingly.

Methodology:
We will implement the legacy features (as appropriate) one by one, using the new hooks-based approach, replacing the code in patch.js, chat.js, etc, with hook-based implementations in hooks/ directory. As we complete items in the to-do section, add check marks next to completed items. Each implementation step must include corresponding unit tests.

Keep the code cleanly organized and well documented, in a format that's amenable to autodocumentation.

To do:

-   [x] **Apply QoL Attack Card Styling:** Modify the attack roll chat message HTML to match the styling and content from legacy dcc-qol, including adding buttons to roll damage, roll critical hit, and roll fumble.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard` (New Setting - Boolean, default true/false TBD). If false, leave core DCC styling untouched.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `renderChatMessage`.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ `templates/attackroll-card.html`, button listener logic in `chat.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify card HTML structure changes correctly based on setting; verify buttons are added and have correct dataset attributes.

-   [x] **Display Hit/Miss:** Read hit/miss status from the chat message data provided by the DCC system and display explicit "Hit" or "Miss" text on the attack chat card.

    -   _Setting:_ `DisplayHitMiss`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `renderChatMessage`, reading data flags/dataset from the message.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ N/A (was previously calculated in `patch.js`, now just reading system data).
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify "Hit"/"Miss" text appears correctly based on mock chat message data flags/dataset and the `DisplayHitMiss` setting.

-   [ ] **Prevent Display of System Damage/Crit/Fumble Results:** Modify the `renderChatMessage` hook logic to prevent the display of the default damage and critical hit/fumble roll results initially generated by the DCC system within the QoL attack roll card. These initial system results should be effectively discarded from view. New rolls will be triggered when the corresponding buttons are clicked.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard` (controls the overall card modification).
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `renderChatMessage`.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ N/A (New requirement).
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify that the default damage/crit/fumble sections are not displayed within the QoL card on initial render when the setting is enabled.

-   [ ] **Display Weapon Properties:** Fetch and display relevant weapon properties (e.g., Melee/Ranged, Range, Equipped status, Trained status, Two-Handed) on the attack card.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `renderChatMessage` (will need to access the weapon item from the actor or message flags).
    -   _Helper Function:_ `utils.js#getWeaponProperties`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify weapon properties are correctly displayed on the card based on mock weapon data.

-   [ ] **Refine Attack Card Styling & Template:** Clean up the `templates/attackroll-card.html` (or equivalent new template) for better structure and apply CSS for a modern look and feel.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `renderChatMessage` (to apply CSS classes), potentially CSS files.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ `templates/attackroll-card.html`, associated CSS.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Visual inspection, potentially snapshot testing of the rendered HTML structure.

-   [ ] **Implement Roll Damage Button:** Add functionality to the "Roll Damage" button on the QoL attack card. Clicking it should perform the damage roll associated with the attack and display the result, replacing the placeholder or hidden system damage roll.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ Listener attached in `renderChatMessage` (or via delegation). Needs to trigger a damage roll, possibly using `actor.rollWeaponDamage()`.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ Damage button logic in `chat.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify clicking the button triggers a damage roll and the result is displayed correctly on the card.

-   [ ] **Implement Roll Crit/Fumble Buttons:** Add functionality to the "Roll Critical Hit" and "Roll Fumble" buttons. Clicking these should trigger the appropriate critical hit or fumble table roll from the DCC system and display the result.

    -   _Setting:_ `useQoLAttackCard`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ Listeners attached in `renderChatMessage`. Needs to trigger appropriate system rolls (e.g., `game.dcc.RollableTables.rollCrit()`, `game.dcc.RollableTables.rollFumble()`).
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ Crit/Fumble button logic in `chat.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify clicking the buttons triggers the correct table rolls and the results are displayed.

-   [ ] **Auto-Apply Damage:** When the damage roll button on the attack card is clicked, automatically apply the rolled damage to the originally targeted token(s).

    -   _Setting:_ `automateDamageApply`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ Likely involves listeners added to damage buttons (via `renderChatMessage` or `Hooks.on('renderChatPopout', ...)`) which then trigger damage application. Investigate DCC system hooks related to damage rolls or chat message updates for potential alternatives.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ Damage application logic likely in `chat.js` button handlers.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify damage is correctly applied to target token(s) when button is clicked and setting is enabled; verify no damage applied if setting disabled.

-   [ ] **Apply Range Modifiers:** Add attack roll penalties based on weapon range increments compared to target distance.

    -   _Setting:_ `checkWeaponRange`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `dcc.modifyAttackRollTerms`.
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ `checkRangePenalty` logic within `rollWeaponAttackQOL` in `patch.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify correct penalty term is added to the roll terms based on weapon range, target distance, and setting state. Test edge cases (within range, exactly at range threshold, beyond range).

-   [ ] **Apply Firing into Melee Penalty:** Add a -1 attack roll penalty if the attacker makes a ranged attack against a target engaged in melee with a friendly combatant.

    -   _Setting:_ `automateFiringIntoMeleePenalty`.
    -   _Primary Hook:_ `dcc.modifyAttackRollTerms` (requires analyzing target's combat engagement relative to other tokens).
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ Firing into melee logic within `rollWeaponAttackQOL` in `patch.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify -1 penalty term is added when conditions are met and setting is enabled; verify no penalty added otherwise. Test various combat positioning scenarios.

-   [ ] **Implement Friendly Fire Check:** When a ranged attack _misses_ a target engaged in melee with one or more friendly combatants, roll 1d2. On a 1, the attack hits a random friendly combatant engaged with the original target. Offer an optional house rule: instead of 1d2, roll 1d9 to determine which adjacent/diagonal square relative to the original target is hit.
    -   _Settings:_ `automateFriendlyFire`, `friendlyFireHouseRuleD9` (New Setting - Boolean, default false).
    -   _Primary Hook:_ Likely requires listening on `renderChatMessage` (or a roll completion hook) to detect a miss under the specified conditions. If conditions met, trigger secondary logic (determine potential friendlies, roll 1d2/1d9, potentially create new chat message or damage application workflow for the friendly hit).
    -   _Legacy Ref:_ Friendly fire check logic within `rollWeaponAttackQOL` in `patch.js`.
    -   _Unit Test:_ Verify secondary check triggers only on miss when conditions met and setting enabled. Verify correct friendly target is chosen (or d9 square identified). Verify no check occurs if setting disabled or conditions not met.
